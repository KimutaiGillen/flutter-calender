# Basic Integration Testing

This is a very basic example of using Riverpod for dependency injection, which simplifies our codebase for integration testing. This is an intermediate level tutorial.

## Steps Taken

These steps are a continuation of this [lesson](https://github.com/seenickcode/fluttercrashcourse-lessons/tree/master/youtube/basic_integration_testing). We will be building off of the code we wrote in that lesson by following the following steps:

1. Install Riverpod `flutter pub add flutter_riverpod`

## How to Run These Integration Tests

1. `flutter test integration_test`
